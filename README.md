   - Each new customer receives a unique QR/barcode for entry.

2. **Entry Management**

   - Entry usage is logged automatically in **EntryConsumption** with each customer visit.

3. **Subscription and Multi-Pass Tracking**
   - The app supports various subscription plans and multi-pass options.
   - **SubscriptionPlans** offers flexible management of different subscription types.

4. **Payment & Credit Management**

   - All transactions are logged in **AccountTransactions** for clear tracking.

5. **Product Management**
   - Reception staff can manage inventory for items like snacks, drinks, and climbing supplies.
   - **ProductConsumption** tracks individual product purchases, and stock adjusts automatically.

6. **Consent Management**
   - **ConsentForms** tracks multiple customer agreements (e.g., liability waivers).
   - Allows viewing of customer consent history for legal compliance.

7. **Employee Accountability**
   - Employees log in with unique credentials.
   - **EmployeeActions** records each employeeâ€™s actions for transparency and accountability.
